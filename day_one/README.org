* Advent of Code Day One

This task is effectively a list processing task.  Given two unsorted
lists, we need to sort the lists, and then do a pairwise comparison of
each elemet of the two lists, find the difference between the two
numbers, and then sum the differences.

Run the tests with:

#+begin_src shell
  clj -M:spec -f d
#+end_src

To be able to run tests in the Cider repl:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq cider-clojure-cli-aliases ":spec")
#+end_src

Then when you jack in to the project, the =spec= alias will be in
scope, and the =speclj= library and the specs will be om the class
path.
