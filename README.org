* Advent of Code 2025

This year I will be solving Advent of Code in Clojure.

In keeping with the guidelines, I will not be providing my input, nor
will I provide the text of the puzzle.  I will simply provide my
thoughts on the solution / implementation, and the solution and tests.

** Getting the input

I wrote a little library for fetching the input for the puzzles:
[[https://github.com/Atalanta/aocifetch][AoCifetch]] - to use it, add the following to =deps.edn=:

#+begin_src clojure
{:deps
 {atalanta/aocifetch
  {:git/url "https://github.com/Atalanta/aocifetch"
   :git/tag "v0.1.0"
   :git/sha "362c1c1bdf47b0fdf1c6b591e355e326d0590004"}}}
#+end_src
